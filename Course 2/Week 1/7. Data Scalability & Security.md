# Data Scalability
Different ways of scalability
  - Scaling up (adding memory) and Scaling out (adding machine)
    - Adding machine is done to relatively slower networks.
  > Better performance achieved by scale up option.
  > But, Big data world, prefers cluster management(Management of many machines, i.e. preference of scaling out over in)

# Data Security
- Increasing number of machines, leads to more security risks, because the data is being uploaded into a cloud.
  - Hence we need to ensure security of not only the machines but also n/w used for the data transfer across different phases of data operations.
  - Encrypting (Done when data gets to the network) and decrypting of data(done when data is at the processing server) is hence done for data storage and analysis across multiple servers, this in turn increases cost.
  - security + processing efficiency = Research issue in big data management.
