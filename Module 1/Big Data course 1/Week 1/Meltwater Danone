how Meltwater helped Danone using sentiment analysis.
Meltwater is a company that helps other companies analyze what people are saying
about them and manage their online reputation.
One of the case studies on their website is about Danone baby nutrition.
Meltwater helped Danone to monitor the opinions through social media for one of
their marketing campaigns. They were able to measure what was impactful and what
was not, through such monitoring.
Meltwater also helped Danone manage a potential reputation issue. When a crisis
occurred related to horse DNA being in some meat products across Europe.
While Danone was confident that they didn't have an issue with their products,
having the information a couple of hours before news hit the UK press.
Allowed them to check and reassure their customers that their products were safe to consume.
You can imagine millions of mothers having been reassured and happy for Danone's
efforts on this.
This is an excellent story about how big data helped manage public opinion.
And I'm sure Meltwater was able to help them to measure the opinion impact
through social media as well.
