# Data Storage
- Store Data
## Storage Infrastructure:
  - 2 storage issues
      1. Storage capacity
         - Size of mem, how many disk units.
      2. Scalability
         - Options: Should the storage devices be attached directly to the computers to make the direct IO fast but less scalable? Or should the storage be attached to the network that connect the computers in the cluster? This would make the disk access bit slower, but allows one to add storage easily.
    - Speed of the IO operation:
      - How fast to read / write:
        - Address with memory heirarchy / storage hierarchy
          - [!memhierarchy.jpg]
          - Top of pyramid: cache memory - lives inside cpu and very fast. L3<L2<L1 (slow to fast).
            - Figure shows speed in terms of response times.
            - Memory stream = 65ns/access
            - **Speed of traditional hard disk = 10 ms/access**
            - This gap has prompted the design of many data structures and algorithms.that use a hard disk but tries to minimize the cost of the IO operations between the fast memory and the slower disk.
          - SSD's - new and faster than spinning hard disk.
          - NVME - non-volatile memory express - makes transfer b/w memory and ssds much faster.
          - Components become increasingly expensive from bottom to top.
          - _**Hence issue of cost-benefit tradeoff**_
