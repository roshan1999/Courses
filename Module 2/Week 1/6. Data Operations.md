# Data operations
- Significant aspect of data management to documetn, define, implement and test set of operations reqd. for specific applications.
- Some operations are independent on type of data and some are dependent because the operations use a particular data model.
  - Two divisions of operation:
    - Operations on single data items that produce sub item
      - Ex: Extracting sub array from array of pixels. (Image = single object)
    - Operations on collections of data items
      - SubCategory : Operations that **select** a part of collection.
        - 1. take collection and filter subset of collection.
          - Ex: Circle with number >3.
        - 2. Merge 2 collections together to form a larger collection.
          - Ex: 2, 3 structure data items fused the node using a common property (2).
        - 3. Compute function on collection and return value.
          - Ex: function is count.
        - **Aggregate function is complicate in reality**
  - Efficiency of data operations:
    - Reduce time and space by parallelism(using threads).
      - Selection is the process of using a subset of data based on a condition
        - Ex:  Selection
            - using subset based on numebr even.
            - For efficiency:
            - Take Data and partition randomly into 2 groups.
            - Run subset algo for each group and get partial results.
            - For this case, it can be sent back without any additional steps.
