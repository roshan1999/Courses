# Data Model
1. Q. What is data model? Why do we care about data model in context of data variety?

> **Self note: Think of a data model as a schema. For ex: Airport management schema -- This is a data model** <br>

> **Record (as mentioned in the videos) - They specify the rows of a table in the data model.**

> **Field (Sometimes interchangebly used in the videos with records) - They specify the values (each field) of the table.**

> **Collection - Table**

A:
## Data model describes data characteristics:
  - Structure - A format of data that provides insights about the data, (field and records instead of plain text)
  - Operations - The corresponding arithmetic operations done while keeping the understanding of the structure described by the data model, is operations.
  - Constraints - Provides a way to detect records that might have error.

### Structure:
  - Structured data - data having Structure
  - What is a structure?
    - Data Properties / attributes - A file having records, with an exact number of fields defined for data entry
    - A repeatable pattern of data organization makes the file structured.
    - Both the file records below are considered structured (even if it has missing values).
    - ![structured_data](./structured.png)
    - _**Structured data have the same data model**_ because they all follow the same data property or attribute system with differing number of fields (PARAMETERS).
  - Unstructured data - Data in which the subparts can't be organized or interpreted.
    - Ex: Audio and video files, Encrypted data.


### Operations
  - They specify the methods to manipulate the data.
  - Operations depend on data model, which differ when the structure differs, Hence, then operation will be different.
  - Some common operations (performed across all data models):
    1. Subsetting (Selection/Filtering) - Extracting part of collection based on condition.
    2. Substructure Extraction (Projection) - Extracting part of the collection. (Ex: Only first 2 fields of the collection)
    3. Combining 2 collections into larger one:
       1. Union: (Def. slide)
          - Both the collections must have the same structure(Attribute same, not necessary that the number of records must be same).
          - Because it's a set operation, duplicates are made into one.
       2. Join: (Def. Slide)
          - Combines 2 data collection that might have different attributes but common elements.
          - Stages of combining:
            1. Finds a match on a record(column) b/w the 2 collections.
            2. Then the fields(row values) of the matching record in the respective collections are put together from both the collection.
          - Operation is more complex, and can be very expensive when the size of the two collections are large.

### Constraints
- It is a logical statement (test that gives true or false as result) that must hold for the data.
- Part of the data model, cuz it can specify the semantics(meaning) of the data.
- Types of constraints:
  1. Value Constraint:
     - Logical statement about data values.
     - Ex: Age can't be negative
  2. Uniqueness constraint
      - Ex: Every movie has only 1 title
      - Hence multiple entries of the same title, is not allowed.
  3. Cardinality Constraint:
       -  It is the bound specified (upper and lower) which provides a check to count the number of values entered and whether it lies between this bound.
       - Ex: Medical example given in slide.
  4. Type Constraint:
     - Enforcing a alphabetic string for last name.
     - It is a special kind of domain constraint.
  5. Domain Constraint
     - It is a constraint of an attribute.
     - It is the possible set of values that are allowed for that attribute.
  6. Structural Constraints / Properties:
     - Restricts the structure of data.
     - For ex: When a **Square** matrix is stored in the form of a table (refer slide). The simple constraint of the matrix being squared is translated to a complex cond. constraint that specifies: the number of data rows (in the table) will be the square of the  number of unique values of column 1 in the table.
